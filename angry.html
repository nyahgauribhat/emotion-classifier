       <div id = "text">The selected raag, Raag Malkauns, evokes a sense of introspection and calmness to soothe and release your raudra rasa (anger). </div> 
            <div id = "text2">Hindu legend says that the serene and meditative Raag Malkauns was composed to soothe Lord Shiva's rage when he lost his wife, Sati.
               The slow tempo (vilambit laya) and resonant notes - Sa, Ma, komal Dha, and komal Niâ€”play a crucial role in shaping its introspective and meditative mood, helping to address the physiological symptoms of anger and calm you down by slowing your heart rate and breathing.
                The use of flat (komal) notes creates a tranquil atmosphere. The longer sustained notes and a gradual progression allow the raag to unfold unhurriedly, giving you time to absorb its calming qualities.
                The meditative environment of the music takes you away from the rapid and overwhelming pace of angry thoughts. You can introspect and reflect to manage and reduce your anger in this state effectively.</div>
