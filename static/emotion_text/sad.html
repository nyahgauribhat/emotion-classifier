       <div id = "text"> <p align = "justify">The musical setting of the selected raag will lift your flagging spirits, your Karuna Rasa (sad emotions), and give you a chance to arrive at some form of release from sadness. </div> 
            <div id = "text2">As a morning raga, Raag Bhairav symbolizes the dawn of a new day, inspiring a sense of renewal and hope, reminding you that every day brings new opportunities and possibilities for happiness and growth. 
                The slow, deliberate tempo (vilambit laya) and the use of both shuddha (natural) and komal (flat) notes create a calming, soothing atmosphere that can help ease tension and bring about a sense of tranquility, which is particularly comforting when you're feeling sad.
                The use of notes like komal Re and komal Dha add a deep, sonorous quality to the music. These notes resonate strongly in the lower and middle octaves, creating a profound, weighty sound that feels substantial and grounding. These tones align with your emotions, allowing you to experience and release your feelings of sadness. This emotional resonance can be cathartic, helping you move through your sadness toward a more balanced emotional state.</p></div>
