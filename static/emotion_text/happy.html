      Raag Tilak Kamod is often used in compositions that celebrate the divine
      playfulness of Lord Krishna who is often depicted joyfully dancing with
      the gopis (milkmaids) or playing his flute. The fast and lively tempo
      (drut laya) will naturally lift your spirits and heighten the lightness of
      happiness and the giddiness of love. The use of natural notes (shuddha
      swaras) contribute to the warm and inviting sound that draw you in. The
      gentle, soothing phrases (pakad) amplify your sense of joy and relaxation.
      The medium (madhya laya) to fast (drut laya) tempo, lively and energetic
      in character enhance the raga's cheerful and celebratory character,
      creating a sense of movement and excitement that will naturally uplifts
      your mood. As artists have eternally proclaimed, “Love, love changes
      everything”, or “Love makes the world go round”, and even “Love is all you
      need”. Here’s to hoping that you are in love, on the cusp of love, are
      beloved, or just betrothed!</p>
