   <div> <p> Hey! <br> <br> 
    It looks like you are in a NEUTRAL and peaceful mood today!<br> <br> </div></div>
       <div>You could keep the calm vibe going and deepen this feeling through a raga. </div> 
            <div>Â 
                Rasa or emotions are associated with ragas, and a raga like Bhairav can sustain Shaanth Rasa for introspection and meditation. The often komal, or flat notes create an atmosphere of seriousness and contemplation. Balanced by a delicate slow to medium tempo (vilambit to madhya laya), you will feel the meditative nature of the composition mirroring your mood. Its primarily madhya, medium octave based notes will ground you in a feeling of balance and comfort, complementing your equilibrium; however, the occasional touch of the lower and higher notes will add depth to keep you engaged.</div> 
            <div> Here are a few minutes of the Bandish or composition of Raga Bhairav. </div>
