   <div> <p> Hey! <br> <br> 
    It looks like you are HAPPY and in a good mood today!<br> <br> </div></div>
       <div>You could try enhancing this happy feeling through a raga. </div> 
            <div>Rasa or emotions are associated with ragas, and a raga like Tilak Kamod can cocoon Shringaar Rasa or romantic love. Its shuddha, or natural notes will mirror your mood; its madhya laya or medium tempo will add an element of playfulness to your day; and its wide-spanning range of all the three octaves – mandra, madhya and tara – or lower, medium and higher, will weave an expression of balance, energy, and depth to appeal to your joyful character. Lastly, the ornamentation of meends, or glides, and gamaks, or oscillations will enhance your experience.
             </div> 
            <div> Here are a few minutes of the Bandish or composition of Raga Tilak Kamod. </div>
        </p>
