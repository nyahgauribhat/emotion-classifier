            <div id = "text2"> With its vibrant and fresh melodies, Raag Bahar mirrors the surprise element of spring. Spring brings sudden blooms, unexpected rain showers, and bursts of new life. The lively and dynamic phrases of Raag Bahar evoke feelings of surprise and delight to increase your sense of Adbhuta Rasa (wonder and rejuvenation).
                The raag predominantly uses shuddha (natural) notes, which are uplifting, and a single komal (flat) note in the descent to add a touch of gentle melancholy, provoking contemplation. The  two feelings evoked mirror the dual nature of spring as a time of renewal and reflection.
                The raag's varied tempo creates a sense of spontaneity: let this encourage you to think outside the box,  steer you towards innovative ideas and solutions, and spark creativity and imagination.
                The zig-zag or twisted notes (vakhras) add a touch of whimsy to encourage a break from reality. Why not take a moment to dream?</div>
